### Project Ideas:
- Card Wiki:  
Chen's Research - easy to  build, can be improved from existing models, requires a lot of style design, lots of backend and data required.  
- Card Journal:  
Ryan, Alan Research - prompt based journaling in postcard format, can be private, card design could be simple, and saved for user to look back on.  
- Credit Card Rewards:  
Max's Research - user is recommended what king of credit card to use for certain purchases, simple UI, no specific card information saved, needs mobile interface for user convenience.  
- Sharable Card Designer:  
Domonick, Kayla, Angel, Thomas Research - similar to canva, can customize card designs and send digitally, could be hard to implement user designs, drag and drop, and other designing features for a good UI.  
- Study Flashcards:  
Daniel, Ashley, Justin Research - can include game-ified features, simple card flipping functions and minimalist UI, could save flashcards as a file to display locally.
