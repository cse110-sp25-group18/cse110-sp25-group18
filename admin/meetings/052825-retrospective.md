## Start
- Having everything done in a timely manner 
- Communicating more about all the features and specifications through Slack or meetings
- Better communication between people working on similar features (sub-teams) for effective merging and avoiding conflicts
- Facilitating communication between people assigned to a feature
- Reply to Slack questions as soon as possible
- Make sure to follow the pull request template: check off all checklist items, add tests, include a screenshot of your changes.

## Stop
- Stop making vague comments on PRs
- Not responding to Slack questions
- Not sharing resources (such as images) on time

## Continue
- Using our CI/CD pipeline
- Communicating over Slack to clear up any questions
- Distributing tasks earlier
- Having specific Github issues
- Knowing everyone's tasks from the beginning of the sprint

## Notes:
- Takes a lot of time to do e2e tests and solving merge conflicts
