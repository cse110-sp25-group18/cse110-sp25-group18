# Use Jest for testing

## Context and Problem Statement

How to ensure code quality before it is pushed to repo?
How to have a preliminary test before code is pushed?
What type of preliminary testing do we want?

## Considered Options
Jest (used in Lab) - Useful for testing individual methods, separate parts
Other JavaScript testing frameworks (e.g. Mocha, Chai, Jasmine)

## Decision Outcome 

Chosen option: “Jest” because it is suitable for testing individual methods, and our project will be based on the work being divided. Members will write individual parts, and each part will be subject to unit tests, to determine if a certain part of the entire program is passing the test.
