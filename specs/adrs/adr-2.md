# Use draw.io for making diagrams involving workflow (e.g. flowchart)

## Context and Problem Statement
How do we plan out/diagram our workflows?
What can we use to draw diagrams?
How should our diagrams look like?

## Considered Options
Figma (can also be used for UI design)
Draw.io (specifically for flowchart diagrams)
Miro (used for brainstorming and can be used for diagrams)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Draw.io because we were familiarilized with it during the lab, and it ensures that we generally stick to a flowchart when outlining our planning process/the process of a workflow. This ensures more uniformity when we are planning our steps.
