# Use JSDoc for Code Documentation

## Context and Problem Statement
How should we document our JavaScript code so that it is understandable to all team members and maintainable over time?
What tool or format should we use to provide inline documentation in our codebase?

## Considered Options
JSDoc: comment-based documentation syntex for JavaScript
README-style documentation: external markdown docs
No formal documentation, just comments when needed

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: JSDoc because it integrates directly into the codebase, supports autocomplete and type hinting in editors, and allows us to describe inputs, outputs, and functionality directly above functions. This improves team collaboration and future maintenance by ensuring all code components are clearly described and accessible.
