# Use JSDoc for Code Documentation

## Context and Problem Statement
How should we document our JavaScript code so that it is understandable to all team members and maintainable over time?
What tool or format should we use to provide inline documentation in our codebase?
Additionally, the documentation process must be automated via GitHub Actions, as required in the assignment.

## Considered Options
JSDoc: comment-based documentation syntax for JavaScript
README-style documentation: external markdown docs
README-style documentation: Manually maintained external Markdown documentation.
No formal documentation, just comments when needed

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: JSDoc because it integrates directly into the codebase, supports autocomplete and type hinting in editors, and allows us to describe inputs, outputs, and functionality directly above functions. This improves team collaboration and future maintenance by ensuring all code components are clearly described and accessible. We use Node.js in GitHub Actions because JSDoc (for JavaScript) and most of the automation tools require it and allow automated, inline code documentation. Tools such as MkDocs doesn't need Node.js but can't auto-generate docs from JS code, so it doesnâ€™t meet our automation needs.
