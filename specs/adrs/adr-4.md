# 04. Use ESLint for JavaScript Code Quality and Style Enforcement

## Date

2025-05-25

## Context and Problem Statement

How can we enforce consistent code style?
How can we catch common erros in our JavaScript codebase?
We need a tool that can automatically flag potential bugs and inconsistencies, especially with so many people contributing to the project.

## Considered Options

- ESLint: highly customizable, supports plugins, widely adopted
- Prettier: for formatting only, not full linting
- No linter, just manual reviews

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: ESLint because it helps us catch issues early, enforce code style, and maintain code quality across team contributions. ESLint is compatible with many IDEs and can be extended to checking things like missing JSDoc comments, making it complementary to our documentation strategy.
