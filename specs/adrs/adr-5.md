# Use Puppeteer for End-to-End Testing

## Context and Problem Statement
How can we test the user experience in a way that is automated and effective?

## Considered Options
Puppeteer: Node.js library designed for Chrome automation.
Selenium: Automation framework that works across several different browsers and programming languages.

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: We will be using Puppeteer for end to end testing because we are already familiar with using Puppeteer, which will save time. Also, since we are using node.js for testing, puppeteer will be easy to use without installing many other dependencies.
