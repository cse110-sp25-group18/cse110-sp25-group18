# Use Figma for Wireframe Design

## Context and Problem Statement
How can we create wireframe designs and mockups of our website results collaboratively?
Several team members will be working together on designing different parts of our app, and therefore we need a platform that is easy to use and collaborative for designing as a team.

## Considered Options
Figma: It's a platform designed for website design, has the ability to share through link and work with others on the same file, also has a lot of templates and features that are useful.
Canva: Has many templates and designs, but it is not as widely used for wireframes.

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: We will be using Figma to create our wireframes and design the overall look of our website in a way that is effective and collaborative.
