# Use Miro for Meeting Planning

## Context and Problem Statement
How can we create flowcharts and diagrams collaboratively and in real time during meetings, for planning and brainstorming?

## Considered Options
Miro: Can be shared through a link to work together in real time, and also has many templates for diagrams and brainstorming flowcharts.
Draw.io: Has many flowchart and diagram features, and it is easy to add these files into our repo for notes.

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: We will use Miro for brainsotrming and planning ideas during meetings. Draw.io is helpful when we are making plans and notes, but it cannot be worked on collaboratively and can be more time-consuming than Miro.
